## Description

Your task is to create an API on top of a couple different databases.  It should conform to the user stories provided below.  You are free to use whatever language you prefer, however our tech stack features NodeJS, Java and Ruby. If you're comfortable with any of these, try to favor them.  Google andÂ the interwebs are at your disposal.

## Improvements

* Multiple filter conditions - Tried combining Year and genre.
* Faced challenges to combine as Genres is a JSON array. 
* Support more filter operators - we only support $eq now
* Use Types for Production Company and Genres. Production Company JSON is not valid for some records.
* Load Config env,need more time to make it work!
